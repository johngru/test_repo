# A test repository
## Motivation
Every great project starts with solid testing.  Github is no exception.
---
### Description
A **sample repository** and sample readme file for connectivity resolution and illustration purposes.

Newly added material will be highlighted by github after each respective commit.
## Example
This readme file is an example using *markdown* for GitHub. It's important for a number of reasons, including:
*User Usability
*Ease of Use
*Installation guidance
*Documentation for future reference
*Reference for edits or major updates.
## Inserting Code
This is a neat example of a code snippet.  Simply add three backticks (```) before and after a code block.
```python
text = "See it looks just like code from your editor.  It even formats according to the specified language, which is specified after the first set of ```"
print(text)
```

## Block Quotes
Sometimes it's cool to draw emphasis on a particular quote.  For this use (>).
>"That's one small step for man.  One giant leap for mankind."
---
## Links
Links are great for connecting the dots between different folders and files.  Or sometimes to direct a reader to a more thorough resource.  To insert a hyperlink just need to "\[text description](link)".
For instance, here's a great thorough resource from GitHub on [basic writing and formatting syntax with GitHub documentation files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## Make it Graphic!
A picture is worth a thousand words.  And it's even better when you have one so you don't have to write a thousand words.  For this, simply insert an exclamation point before the hyperlink syntax.  For example, just use: \![Image Alt Text](link to image).
